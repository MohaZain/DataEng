# Data Engineering

## [Data Modeling](https://github.com/MohaZain/DataEng/tree/main/data-modeling-postgres)
 * Create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play for a startup called Sparkify that wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.

## [Cloud Data Warehouses with AWS Redshift](https://github.com/MohaZain/DataEng/blob/main/DWH-data-werehouse/README.md)

* A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.
* To process the data I build an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to

## [Spark and Data Leke](https://github.com/MohaZain/DataEng/tree/main/DataLake)
* Build an ETL pipeline for a data lake. The data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in the app. load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3.

## [Data Pipelines with Airflow](https://github.com/MohaZain/DataEng/tree/main/Data%20Pipelines)
* Schedule, automate, and monitor data pipelines using Apache Airflow. Run data quality checks.
* The pipeline Extract data from (S3) Bucket into AWS Redshift data warehouses 

## [Immigration Project](https://github.com/MohaZain/DataEng/edit/main/ImigrationTempretureProject/README.md)
* using Spark to transform [I94 Immigration Data](https://www.trade.gov/national-travel-and-tourism-office) and [World Temperature Data](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data) to [star schema](https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/star-schema) and perform the nasscary step To be ready to query multiple analytics questions.
